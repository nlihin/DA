    "First, let's get familiar with Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are made up of \"cells\" that can contain text or code. Notebooks also show you output of the code right below a code cell. These words are written in a text cell using a simple formatting dialect called [markdown](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Double click on this cell text or press enter while the cell is selected to see how it is formatted and change it. We can make words *italic* or **bold** or add [links](http://datasciencecourse.net) or include pictures:\n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter planet](jupiter.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the notebook, as you edit in your browser, is written to the `.ipynb` file we provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to read up on Notebooks in details check out the [excellent documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting aspect of notebooks, however, is that we can write code in the cells cells. You can use [many different programming languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) in Jupyter notebooks, but we'll stick to Python. So, let's try it out:\n",

    "## Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks have two modes, a **command mode** and **edit mode**. You can see which mode you're in by the color of the cell: green means edit mode, blue means command mode. Many operations depend on your mode. You can switch into edit mode with \"Enter\", and get out of it with \"Escape\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Shortucts\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can always use the tool-bar above, you'll be much more efficient if you use a couple of shortcuts. The most important ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Ctrl+Enter`** runs the current cell.  \n",
    "**`Shift+Enter`** runs the current cell and jumps to the next cell.   \n",
    "**`Alt+Enter`** runs the cell and adds a new one below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode:\n",
    "**`h`** shows a help menu with all these commands.  \n",
    "**`a`** adds a cell before the current cell.  \n",
    "**`b`** adds a cell after the current cell.  \n",
    "**`dd`** deletes a cell.  \n",
    "**`m`** as in **m**markdown, switches a cell to markdown mode.  \n",
    "**`y`** as in p**y**thon switches a cell to code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you [run code](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), the code is actually executed in a **kernel**. You can do bad thinks to a kernel: you can make it stuck in an endless loop, crash it, corrupt it, etc. And you probably will do all of these things :). So sometimes you might have to interrupt your kernel or restart it. Use the \"Kernel\" menu to restart the kernel, re-run your notebook, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, before submitting a homework or a project, make sure to `Restart and Run All`. This will create a clean run of your project, without any side effects that you might encounter during development. We want you to submit the homeworks **with output**, and by doing that you will make sure that we actually can also execute your code properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks contain both, the input to a computation and the outputs. If you run a notebook, all the outputs generated by the code cells are also stored in the notebook. That way, you can look at notebooks also in non-interactive environments, like on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook itself is stored in a rather ugly format containing the text, code, and the output. This can sometimes be challenging when working with version control."
